# ðŸ§  LEARNING TRANSFER: TIMELINE-DEBUGGING

**Date:** 2025-06-02 12:16:17  
**Category:** debugging  
**Token Savings:** 200+ tokens  
**Confidence:** High

## ðŸ’¡ BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERED:
Direct sequence.getInPoint() and getOutPoint() works reliably (MVX pattern)

## ðŸš€ IMPLEMENTATION (Copy Exactly):
```javascript
var inPoint = sequence.getInPoint(); var outPoint = sequence.getOutPoint();
```

## âœ… VALIDATION:
Tested successfully, works better than complex detection

## ðŸ“‹ USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Copy** the implementation above exactly as shown
2. **Apply** without modifications  
3. **Expect** 200+ token savings immediately
4. **Validate** with simple test to confirm working

## ðŸŽ¯ TRANSFER SUMMARY:
- **Problem Solved:** Direct sequence.getInPoint() and getOutPoint() works reliably (MVX pattern)
- **Solution Ready:** Copy-paste implementation above
- **Benefit:** Skip rediscovery, save 200+ tokens
- **Status:** âœ… READY FOR IMMEDIATE USE
