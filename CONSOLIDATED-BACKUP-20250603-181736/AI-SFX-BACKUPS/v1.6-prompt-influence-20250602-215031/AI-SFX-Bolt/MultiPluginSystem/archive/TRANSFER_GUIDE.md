- âœ… Shares common Adobe plugin knowledge
- âœ… Allows easy contribution of new discoveries
- âœ… Scales to unlimited plugins

## Transfer Instructions for Your Other Session

### Step 1: Tell Claude in Your Other Session

Copy and paste this message:

---

I have a shared knowledge system from another Adobe plugin project located at:
`~/Documents/Code/Personal Projects/Premiere Plugins/Ai SFX/AI-SFX-Bolt/MultiPluginSystem/shared-knowledge/`

This contains proven solutions for:
- Timeline detection and manipulation
- ExtendScript patterns that work
- CEP debugging setup
- Professional UI patterns
- Automation scripts

Please add this section to my current plugin's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Shared Knowledge Access

Access proven patterns from other Adobe plugin development:

### Browse Available Knowledge
```bash
# See all debugging solutions
ls ~/Documents/Code/Personal Projects/Premiere Plugins/Ai SFX/AI-SFX-Bolt/MultiPluginSystem/shared-knowledge/debugging/

# See UI patterns
ls ~/Documents/Code/Personal Projects/Premiere Plugins/Ai SFX/AI-SFX-Bolt/MultiPluginSystem/shared-knowledge/ui-patterns/

# See Adobe API patterns
ls ~/Documents/Code/Personal Projects/Premiere Plugins/Ai SFX/AI-SFX-Bolt/MultiPluginSystem/shared-knowledge/adobe-apis/
```

### Get Specific Knowledge
```bash
# Timeline detection breakthrough
cat ~/Documents/Code/Personal Projects/Premiere Plugins/Ai SFX/AI-SFX-Bolt/MultiPluginSystem/shared-knowledge/debugging/timeline-detection-breakthrough.md

# Glass UI effects
cat ~/Documents/Code/Personal Projects/Premiere Plugins/Ai SFX/AI-SFX-Bolt/MultiPluginSystem/shared-knowledge/ui-patterns/glass-effect-ui.md

# ExtendScript patterns
cat ~/Documents/Code/Personal Projects/Premiere Plugins/Ai SFX/AI-SFX-Bolt/MultiPluginSystem/shared-knowledge/adobe-apis/extendscript-static-methods.md
```

### Quick Search
```bash
# Search for specific topics
grep -r "timeline" ~/Documents/Code/Personal Projects/Premiere Plugins/Ai SFX/AI-SFX-Bolt/MultiPluginSystem/shared-knowledge/
```
```

When I discover something useful for all Adobe plugins, I'll save it to the shared knowledge folder.

### Step 2: Using Shared Knowledge

In your other session, when you need help:

```bash
# "I need to detect timeline in/out points"
cat ~/Documents/.../shared-knowledge/debugging/timeline-detection-breakthrough.md

# "I need professional UI styling"  
cat ~/Documents/.../shared-knowledge/ui-patterns/glass-effect-ui.md

# "My ExtendScript functions aren't working"
cat ~/Documents/.../shared-knowledge/adobe-apis/extendscript-static-methods.md
```

### Step 3: Contributing Back

When your other plugin discovers something useful:

```bash
# Save to shared knowledge
echo "Your breakthrough discovery" > ~/Documents/.../shared-knowledge/category/new-discovery.md
```
