### 📁 **BACKUP LOCATIONS:**

**Latest Complete Backup:** `v1.4-pre-bolt-migration-20250602-102048/`
**Previous Working Backup:** `v1.3-inout-feature-complete-20250602-101214/`

### 🔄 **RESTORATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

**If Bolt migration breaks anything:**

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "/Users/richardtran/Documents/Code/Personal Projects/Premiere Plugins/Ai SFX"

# Stop any development servers
# Ctrl+C to stop yarn dev if running

# Remove current CEP-Plugin (backup first if needed)
mv CEP-Plugin CEP-Plugin-broken-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Restore from backup
cp -r AI-SFX-BACKUPS/v1.4-pre-bolt-migration-20250602-102048 CEP-Plugin

# Verify symlink is still active
ls -la "/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/AI-SFX-Generator"

# If symlink broken, recreate:
sudo rm -rf "/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/AI-SFX-Generator"
sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/CEP-Plugin" "/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/AI-SFX-Generator"

# Restart Premiere Pro
echo "✅ Original working plugin restored!"
```

### 💡 **MIGRATION APPROACH:**

**Safe Migration Strategy:**
1. ✅ Create backup (DONE)
2. ✅ Keep original CEP-Plugin untouched during migration
3. ✅ Create Bolt project in separate directory
4. ✅ Test Bolt version thoroughly before replacing original
5. ✅ Only replace when Bolt version matches 100% functionality

### 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR BOLT MIGRATION:**

**The Bolt version must match ALL current functionality:**
- [ ] In-N-Out point detection (exact timing)
- [ ] Audio placement at in-point (not playhead)
- [ ] Smart track collision detection
- [ ] Automatic track creation via QE API
- [ ] 22s duration limits with warnings
- [ ] Visual state management (green highlights)
- [ ] Eleven Labs API integration
- [ ] File organization into "AI SFX" bin
- [ ] Real-time timeline monitoring
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

### 🚨 **ROLLBACK TRIGGERS:**

**Immediately rollback if:**
- Any core feature stops working
- Performance degrades significantly
- Development becomes more complex
- User experience suffers
- Timeline integration breaks
- API calls fail

### 📞 **EMERGENCY RESTORATION:**

**If something goes wrong during migration:**

```bash
# One-line emergency restore:
cd "/Users/richardtran/Documents/Code/Personal Projects/Premiere Plugins/Ai SFX" && rm -rf CEP-Plugin && cp -r AI-SFX-BACKUPS/v1.4-pre-bolt-migration-20250602-102048 CEP-Plugin && echo "🚑 EMERGENCY RESTORE COMPLETE!"
```

### 🔍 **BACKUP VERIFICATION:**

**Verified backup contains:**
- ✅ All working source files (main.js, safe-timeline.jsx, etc.)
- ✅ Complete UI implementation (index.html, style.css)
- ✅ Working ExtendScript functions
- ✅ Manifest and debug configurations
- ✅ Documentation and debugging code

### 🎮 **TESTING CHECKLIST AFTER RESTORE:**

1. [ ] Plugin loads in Premiere Pro
2. [ ] Timeline info displays correctly
3. [ ] In-N-Out mode activates (green highlight)
4. [ ] Audio generation works with exact duration
